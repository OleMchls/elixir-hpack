# HPack (RFC 7541) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nesQuick/elixir-hpack.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nesQuick/elixir-hpack)

Implementation of the [HPack](https://http2.github.io/http2-spec/compression.html) protocol, a compression format for efficiently representing HTTP header fields, to be used in HTTP/2.

## Installation

1. Add hpack to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

  ```elixir
  def deps do
    [{:hpack, "~> 3.0.0"}]
  end
  ```

## Usage
The HPack library has a simple interface. You will need two functions:

### Decoding
```elixir
ctx = HPack.Table.new(1_000)
{:ok, table, headers} = HPack.decode(ctx, (<< 0x82 >>)
# => {:ok, ..., [{":method", "GET"}]}
```

### Encoding
```elixir
ctx = HPack.Table.new(1_000)
{:ok, table, hbf} = HPack.encode(ctx, [{":method", "GET"}])
# => {:ok, ..., << 0b10000010 >>}
```

## Acknowledgements
The [cowboy hpack implementation](https://github.com/ninenines/cowlib/blob/d0cd6dcb338425a24f85f37ab1ba6d9aeaca89bb/src/cow_hpack.erl#L563) by Lo√Øc Hoguin (@essen) was a great help while writing this library.

## feature wishes / ideas / contribute
Nice to have:
- transcoding for intermediaries (`never indexed`)
- handle small tables in a performant way (keep track of headers)

*please write test <3*
